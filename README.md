# MySQL Connection Pool and Server Management

This repository contains a C++ application designed to efficiently manage MySQL database connections through a connection pool, ensuring thread safety and adhering to RAII principles. The application demonstrates best practices for managing database connections, executing SQL queries securely, and handling resources in a multi-threaded environment.

## Overview

The core functionality revolves around the `MySqlConnectionPool` class, which implements a connection pool to manage a specified number of connections to a MySQL database. This approach significantly reduces the overhead associated with repeatedly opening and closing connections, thereby enhancing the efficiency and scalability of database operations in multi-threaded applications.

### Key Features

- **Connection Pool Management**: Dynamically maintains a pool of active database connections for reuse, minimizing the performance overhead of establishing connections.
- **Thread Safety**: Ensures that database connections can be safely accessed and modified by multiple threads, using `std::mutex` for synchronization.
- **RAII Compliance**: Automates resource management, ensuring that all resources (e.g., database connections) are properly released when no longer needed.
- **Health Check Mechanism**: Regularly verifies the validity of connections using the `isConnectionValid` method, replacing any invalid connections to maintain the pool's integrity.

## Implementation Details

### RAII Compliance

The application follows the RAII principle by managing resources through object lifetimes. This is evident in the use of smart pointers (`std::shared_ptr`, `std::unique_ptr`) to automatically manage the memory of database connections, statements, and result sets, ensuring that resources are properly released without manual intervention.

### Thread Safety

Thread safety is achieved by protecting shared resources with `std::mutex`, preventing simultaneous modifications by multiple threads. This is crucial in the `MySqlConnectionPool` class, where connections are shared across different threads. The mutex locks ensure that only one thread can modify the connection pool at any given time, thus preventing race conditions and data corruption.

### Connection Pool Management

The `MySqlConnectionPool` class encapsulates the logic for connection pool management. It pre-allocates a fixed number of database connections and reuses these connections for database operations. When a connection is requested, the pool checks for an available connection, validates its health, and then provides it to the requester. Once the operation is complete, the connection is returned to the pool for future use.

### Health Check Mechanism

The health of each connection is monitored through the `isConnectionValid` method, which executes a simple query (`SELECT 1`) to test the connection's viability. If a connection fails this check, it is considered invalid and is replaced with a new connection, ensuring the pool only contains healthy connections.

## Usage

To integrate this connection pool into your application, include the provided classes and initiate a `MySqlConnectionManager` instance with your database configuration. Utilize the `getConnection` and `returnConnection` methods to manage database connections within your application's operations.

## Compilation and Dependencies

This project requires the MySQL Connector/C++ to interact with MySQL databases. Ensure that the connector is installed and properly configured in your build environment. Compile the application with a C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later.
